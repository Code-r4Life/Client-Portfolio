              In May 2025, I had the opportunity to accompany the OU Sooner Racing Team to the Formula SAE (FSAE) international competition in Michigan. This event brought together student teams from across the globe to compete in a rigorous, hands-on engineering challengeâ€”designing, building, and racing a Formula-style car.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-6">
              This was more than just a competitionâ€”it was a transformative learning experience for our students and a powerful example of engineering in action. The team demonstrated outstanding commitment, creativity, and teamwork throughout the week. I was honored to support them and proud of their representation of the University of Oklahoma.
